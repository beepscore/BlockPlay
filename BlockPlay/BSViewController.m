/**
 * Questioner: what will be logged, in what order?
 * My answer
 * 1,
 * I know dispatch_sync can be risky.
 * dispatch_sync will block until it executes, so 2 will be followed by 3.
 * 4 will come after 3
 * 2 possible orders?
 * 1,2,3,4,5 or 1,5,2,3,4
 *
 * Questioner: Nope.
 * Execution deadlocks on dispatch_sync.
 *
 * can see this in Xcode, tap logButton, app stops with message:
 * Thread 5: EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION(code=EXC_I386_INVOP,subcode=0x0)
 * call stack Thread 5 0_dispatch_sync_wait detail shows
 * "BUG IN CLIENT OF LIBDISPATCH: dispatch_sync called on queue already owned by current thread"
 *

    // Discussion
    // Objective C
    // Block captures self, but I think it doesn't have retain cycles between any objects.
    // But may be safest to use weak reference.
    // In addition, if user navigates away from view, we might want viewController to be deallocated.
    // Block could accomplish by using weak self
    // https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/WorkingwithBlocks/WorkingwithBlocks.html

    // Swift
    // Similar to Swift closure capture list [weak self]
    // gizmoManager.observeGizmos { [weak self] (error) -> Void in
    //
    // https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html
    // Weak and Unowned References
    // unowned may be faster than weak, so more performant to use it if ok.
